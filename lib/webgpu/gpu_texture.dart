/// One texture consists of one or more texture subresources, each uniquely
/// identified by a mipmap level and, for 2d textures only, array layer and
/// aspect.
///
/// A texture subresource is a subresource: each can be used in different
/// internal usages within a single usage scope.
///
/// Each subresource in a mipmap level is approximately half the size, in each
/// spatial dimension, of the corresponding resource in the lesser level.
/// The subresource in level 0 has the dimensions of the texture itself.
/// These are typically used to represent levels of detail of a texture.
/// Sampler and WGSL provide facilities for selecting and interpolating between
/// levels of detail, explicitly or automatically.
///
/// A "2d" texture may be an array of array layers. Each subresource in a layer
/// is the same size as the corresponding resources in other layers. For non-2d
/// textures, all subresources have an array layer index of 0.
///
/// Each subresource has an aspect. Color textures have just one aspect: color.
/// Depth-or-stencil format textures may have multiple aspects: a depth aspect,
/// a stencil aspect, or both, and may be used in special ways, such as in
/// depthStencilAttachment and in "depth" bindings.
///
/// A "3d" texture may have multiple slices, each being the two-dimensional
/// image at a particular z value in the texture. Slices are not separate
/// subresources.
